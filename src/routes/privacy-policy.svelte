			The following terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”) govern your use of the

			home page, splash pages and all other pages under the same top level domain name, and all
			content thereon (the “Site”) as provided by Heaven’s Door Spirits (“Heaven’s Door” or “We”).
		</p>
		<p>
			BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS APPLIED TO YOUR

		</p>
		<p>
			OUR PRIVACY POLICY Heaven’s Door (hereinafter “Heaven’s Door” or “We”) recognizes the
			importance of your privacy and We are committed to protecting the information We collect from
			you. The following privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs your use of the Heaven’s Door
			website https://www.heavensdoor.com/, which includes without limitations, the home page and
			all other pages under the same top level domain name, and all content thereon (the “Site”) as
			provided by Heaven’s Door. We may change the Privacy Policy from time to time and at any time
			without notice to you by posting such changes on the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the
			terms of this Privacy Policy, which are also incorporated by reference into the Terms and
			Conditions for use of the Site which can be accessed as the following link to which you must
			agree to in order to use the Site. We know that you care how information about you is used and
			shared, and We appreciate your trust that We will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting
			the Heaven’s Door Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. ​
			California Consumer Privacy Rights This California Consumer Privacy Statement applies solely
			to the personal information we collect online and offline of California consumers (excluding
			Heaven's Door employees, applicants and other personnel). This Statement is designed to
			address the relevant legal notice requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
			(the “CCPA”). You have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described
			below: Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to
			you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed [and sold, not applicable
			here] about you during the past 12 months. To submit an access request call/email us at
			info@heavensdoor.com Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal
			information we have collected from you. To submit a deletion request call/email us at
			info@heavensdoor.com Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt out of the sale of your
			personal information. For information about how to manage cookies and opt out of online
			interest-based advertising, please see the “Opt Out” section of our Privacy and Cookie Notice.
			Your opt-out will be specific to the web browser or device you use at the time you exercise
			your opt-out rights; if you use multiple web browsers or devices, you will need to opt-out
			from each browser and device. Opting out of the sale of your information for interest-based
			advertising purposes does not mean you will stop seeing ads, including interest-based ads, and
			your information that was collected prior to 90 days before your opt-out request may be
			further used for interest-based advertising purposes. Please understand that we will still
			share your information in ways that are not a “sale,” such as with our service providers, for
			our own online advertising purposes. Please note: You must provide consumers with two or more
			methods for submitting access requests, including at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number
			and a website address. You must also make reasonable efforts to verify that the person making
			the request is either the consumer about whom the information was collected, or authorized to
			request this information on behalf of the consumer as outlined above. ​ Heaven's Door does not
			track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising
			and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites
			do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to
			tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, Safari allows you to set the
			DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not
			want to be tracked. What Information Do We Collect? We collect information from you when you
			visit the Site, whether through the Site or via alternative means, including but not limited
			to completion of Heaven’s Door documents and forms. In this section, We describe what types of
			personal data We collect, the ways We collect it, and how We use it. While We have tried to be
			complete, this list is not necessarily exhaustive, given that these activities can vary from
			time to time. When We collect information, We will tell you at the point of collection what
			information is required and what information is optional. We collect personal information both
			directly from the information you provide us with as well as automatically as you navigate
			through the Site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses,

			Collected Through Data Collection Technologies As is the case with many websites, our Site may
			use cookies and other automated information collection means. Cookies are small files that a
			site or its service provider transfers to your computer hard drive through your web browser,
			if you allow, that enables the Site or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser
			and capture and remember certain information. Cookies also help us upgrade our Site by showing
			when and how users use our Site. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent
			or refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of our Site might not work without cookies.

			required to do so by law. Where We use your email or other digital means to communicate
			marketing information to you, We will seek your prior consent where required to do so by law.

			visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected except to
			help Heaven’s Door conduct and improve our business. You may disallow receiving cookies at any
			time through your web browser. Although you may still use the Site if you reject cookies, some
			functionality, such as the shopping cart, may be limited. Our Site may also use IP addresses
			for the same purposes identified above, as well as to analyze trends, administer our Site,
			track users’ movements and online activity and gather broad demographic information for
			aggregate use. We may use web beacons (also known as Internet tags or clear GIFs) on our Site
			to access and set cookies and otherwise help us to better understand how users are moving
			through our Site. Information provided by the web beacon includes the computer’s IP address,
			the type of browser being used, traffic data, location data, information about your computer
			and internet connection, and the time that the web beacon was viewed. We may also use web
			beacons in emails and newsletters so that We know when such communications have been opened
			and to otherwise help us tailor our communications to individual users. The information We
			collect automatically is statistical data and may contain personal information. It helps us to
			improve our Site and to deliver a better and more personalized service, by enabling us to:

			Information about our members, registrants, sponsors and exhibitors (collectively “Users”) is
			an important part of our business, and We are not in the business of selling it to others. We
			share customer information only as described below and with such entities that either are
			subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described
			in this Privacy Policy. Data We collect may also be processed by staff operating outside the
			European Economic Area(the“EEA”) who work with us or for us, or for one of our affiliated
			companies, suppliers or service providers. Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other
			companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include agencies
			providing marketing assistance, providing conference administration assistance, processing
			credit card payments, and providing User service. They have access to personal information
			needed to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes. Affiliated
			Businesses: We work closely with affiliated businesses, namely the companies sponsor or
			exhibit on the Heaven’s Door Site or at conferences. These businesses may be provided your
			name, address, email address, and phone number to send you promotional offerings. We cannot
			control and nor are We liable for contact attempts from these companies to you. Our affiliated
			businesses will process your data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
			2016/679 and any implementing legislation (the “GDPR”) and other relevant data protection
			laws. Promotional Offers: Sometimes We send offers to users on behalf of other businesses. If
			you do not want to receive such offers, please let us know by contacting us at
			info@heavensdoor.com. Release: We release account and other personal information when We
			believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions
			and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Heaven’s Door, our Users,
			or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
			fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, this does not include selling, renting,
			sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from users for commercial
			purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. Transfers Outside
			the European Economic Area If and when transferring your personal data outside the EEA (which
			consists of EU member states and Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway), We will only do so using
			one of the following safeguards: the transfer is to a non-EEA country which has an adequacy
			decision by the EU Commission; the transfer is covered by a contractual agreement, which
			covers the GDPR requirements relating to transfers to countries outside the EEA; the transfer
			is to an organization which has Binding Corporate Rules approved by an EU data protection
			authority; or the transfer is to an organization in the US that is EU-US Privacy Shield
			certified. You may request a copy of any relevant document in relation to transfers of your
			personal data outside the EEA by contacting us at info@heavensdoor.com. Your Rights You are
			entitled to obtain information from us on how We handle your personal data, to see copies of
			all personal data held by us and to request that your personal data is amended, corrected or
			deleted from our systems. You can also limit, restrict or object to the processing of your
			data. We do not carry out any decision-making based solely on automated processing, including
			profiling. If you gave us your consent to use your data, e.g. so that We can send you
			marketing emails, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that even if you
			withdraw your consent, We can still rely on the consent you gave as the lawful basis for
			processing your personal data before you withdrew your consent. You can object to our use of
			your personal data. If you would like to exercise any of your above rights, contact at
			info@heavensdoor.com. How Do We Protect Your Information? The security of your personal
			identifying information (such as your credit card number) is important to Heaven’s Door.
			Therefore, We implement a variety of appropriate technical and organizational security
			measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or
			alteration. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer
			(“SSL”) technology and then encrypted into the payment gateway provider’s database only to be
			accessible by authorized individuals. After a transaction, your private information (credit
			card number, etc.) will not be stored on Heaven’s Door servers. Please keep in mind, however,
			there is no such thing as perfect security, and no Internet transmission is ever completely
			secure or error-free. Moreover, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
			username and password you use, if applicable. Do We Disclose Any Information to Outside
			Parties? We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal
			identifying information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist in operating
			the Site, conducting business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this
			information confidential. However, non-personal identifying visitor information may be
			provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Your Consent By using
